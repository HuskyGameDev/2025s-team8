# Hell's Dungeon
An extraction dungeon crawler

Bryson's Informal notes (bless those who want to decipher this)
much of the mechanics are inspired off a 4.2 tutorial

collision -> mask = 10- the player hurtbox will be using this to attack "enemies"
	collision layer is set to 0

hitboxes for the player monitoring it turned activated during attack state
	should not be constantly in an attacking state
